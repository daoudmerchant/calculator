To construct a fully functioning in-browser calculator

## Thoughts before beginning

Oh God... I can feel that I'm going to get stuck on this one at various points. However, since for the last few projects (which felt more like an execise and less like a summary of your current ability) I paid little to no attention to presentational concerns, here I'm going to really 'spit and polish' the way it looks. I won't move on until I'm really happy with it.
